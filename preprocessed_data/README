train_data.npy - A numpy list of length number of utterances (currently 25).
Each item in the list is a numpy list of dimension (timestep, 40) where 40 represents the number of mel features
after generating the melspectograms during feature engineering.

dev_data.npy - A numpy list of length number of utterances (currently 8).
Each item in the list is a numpy list of dimension (timestep, 40) where 40 represents the number of mel features
after generating the melspectograms during feature engineering.

test_data.npy - A numpy list of length number of utterances (currently 2).
Each item in the list is a numpy list of dimension (timestep, 40) where 40 represents the number of mel features
after generating the melspectograms during feature engineering.

train_labels.npy - A numpy list of length number of utterances (currently 25).
Each item in the list is a numpy list of dimension (timestep, ) where the value at each timestep/frame is an integer
where 0 denotes silence and any number greater than 0 is the integer mapping of the respective phoneme

dev_labels.npy - A numpy list of length number of utterances (currently 8).
Each item in the list is a numpy list of dimension (timestep, ) where the value at each timestep/frame is an integer
where 0 denotes silence and any number greater than 0 is the integer mapping of the respective phoneme

test_labels.npy - A numpy list of length number of utterances (currently 2).
Each item in the list is a numpy list of dimension (timestep, ) where the value at each timestep/frame is an integer
where 0 denotes silence and any number greater than 0 is the integer mapping of the respective phoneme

utilities.py - A Python file containing the utilities necessary for data engineering required during model building
and training. Currently contains a dictionary called PHONEME_MAPPER that maps the integer representation of each phoneme
present in each frame labels to it's respective phoneme string. (e.g 0 maps to 'SIL' or Silence and 1 maps to 'AE').
For ease of understanding the ascending order of the integer index also map to the ascending lexicographic order of the
phonemes except for 0 which denotes silence.
